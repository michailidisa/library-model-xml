Presentation of the Library Model in XML

In our example we will use XML to develop a vocabulary in order to model the basic operations of libraries in universities. The basic operations are referred on the process that a user loans a copy of a book. Furthermore, we also included the personnel of the Library, in order to have a better general representation of each library.
